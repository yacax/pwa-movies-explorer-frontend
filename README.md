# Movie Search and Save Service - Frontend Part

This repository represents the frontend part of the diploma project, a service where users can search for films and save them in their personal account.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to build a service that allows users to search for films and save their favourite ones in a personal space. The user enters keywords into the search bar and clicks on the "Search" button. Then, two actions are performed:

1. A request is sent to our movie data service to retrieve and save data.
2. Films corresponding to the selected genre are found and displayed as cards.

When a user saves a film, it appears in a special section of the website.

## Site Structure

The website consists of several pages:

- **Home**: Contains information about the completed project.
- **Films**: Features a form to search for films and a block with search results.
- **Saved Films**: Displays films that the user has saved.
- **Registration**: Allows the user to register an account.
- **Authorization**: The user can log into the system.
- **Profile Editing**: The user can modify the details of their account.
